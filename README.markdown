toolchest - statically compiled tools for consultants (so far just tmux)
========================================================================

Summary
-------

1. Copy the executable to the client box.
2. Run it.
3. Profit.

Motivation
----------

Sometimes you need to install a tool, but your client is on an old, unsupported
distro release, or you don't have root, or gcc isn't installed, or you run
into dependency Hell.

Life's too short for that. Just scp a single, statically compiled binary,
and get on with your work.
